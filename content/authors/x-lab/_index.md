**AIlearning** is designed by three freshmen from **computer science** and **data science and engineering** in East China Normal University (华东师范大学).This project is based on the concept of design thinking. The team received the assistance of Mr. Huang Bo, Mr. Wang Wei, and all the teaching assistants.

**AIlearning** is a website dedicated to finding customer personalized tags to quickly and accurately identify customer needs for AI learning in a specific direction. 

Contents of our project:

- Visual map analysis AI course heat

- Provide recommended AI courses

- Develop the learning route of AI courses

Algorithm steps:

- Realize detailed classification based on the existing courses on GitHub, add course labels, and achieve the effect of highly efficient recommendation

- After the user selects a course, the system will automatically search for relevant courses (advanced courses) to provide recommended options

Your attention to our project would be highly appreciated. We hope that customers who use our website can give us your valuable comments.

<font color='orangered'>* We are always looking for highly-motivated students to work with us on the exciting area of computer science. If you are interested, please contact us by email.</font>
